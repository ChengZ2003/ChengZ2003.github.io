I am a senior studying data science and big data technology at the School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at Wuhan Textile University. Currently, I am interning at LinkTime Cloud, where I focus on developing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) + Agent workflows utilizing large language models (LLMs).
